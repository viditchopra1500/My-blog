My first fullstack project .
Its a blog application which uses WYSIWYG editors.

But its completely more than that , I have used react.js to implement rich design and used CK editor for developing the rich text editor.

Concepts used->
1)routing - used routing to move from one page to another.

2)Implemented the node.js server to communicate with the database.

3)use mongoose to access the data.

4)Axios to communicate with my backend.

5)Used CKeditor for implementing the beautiful text editor.

6)Finally also used bootstrap for the buttons and navs
